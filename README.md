# ELF-Ripper

ELF-Ripper is a powerful Visual Studio Code extension tailored for analyzing ELF files and optimizing firmware memory usage in embedded projects. With comprehensive features like a Build Analyzer and Dashboard, it provides detailed insights into memory allocation and ELF file structure, enabling developers to make informed decisions to optimize their firmware builds and troubleshoot memory-related issues effectively.

Key features include:
- A **Build Analyzer** that replicates the STM Cube IDE's functionality, offering a user-friendly tree view of memory allocation with search, ordering, and progress indicators.
- A **Dashboard** that organizes ELF analysis data into easy-to-read tables, presenting essential information similar to the `readelf` commands.
- Current integration with **CMake Tools**, allowing automatic execution path configuration based on active build targets, with plans to expand support to other embedded build systems in the future.

Whether you're debugging firmware or seeking to optimize memory usage, ELF-Ripper equips you with the tools needed to enhance your development workflow.
